# Unique Professions

**âš  Early Development Stage! Use at Your Own Risk!**

Unique Professions is plugin for Spigot Minecraft servers which adds different professions for players like a Miner, Farmer, and Blacksmith. 

A player is allowed to have only one profession at a time, which helps to increase the cooperation, trade, and a player-driven economy. 

It is aimed at making multiplayer gameplay dependent on each other and encouraging players to interact and trade with each other.
